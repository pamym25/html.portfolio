<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am 26 years old. Aspiring Web Developer. <br />
  I am a beginner and has zero background on coding. <br />
  Here I am, making a simple Portfolio Project. Feel free to browse! <br />
</p>

<p>
  As a career shifter, I know that learning a new skill is vital. <br />
  That's why I decided to enroll an online course at Udemy. <br />
  I enrolled the "Complete Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. <br />
  I am looking forward to learn a lot from this course and <br />
  Be able to apply all acquired knowledge in the future. <br />
</p>

<p>
  What I do to fully understand and be able to execute the projects are, <br />
  making the projects as my end goal every lesson. <br />
  I challenge myself to sometimes even do it without watching the instructions first. Lol <br />
  Fortunately, I always find ways to create the projects well <br />
  And have a satisfaction feeling whenever I finished it. <br />
  I am looking forward to further lessons where I will be able to design a website on my own. <br />
  Cheers! <br />
